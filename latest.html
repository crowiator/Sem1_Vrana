            <h3>Vettel admits Leclerc ‘in different league’</h3>
            Sebastian Vettel admits his teammate Charles Leclerc is currently in “a different league” with the 2020 Ferrari.
            The Maranello team entered a deep competitive slump this year, but three consecutive races of car updates powered Leclerc to an impressive fourth on the grid in Portimao – just over a tenth from Max Verstappen.
            “We have taken the time to analyse and understand what the problem with the car could be,” said sporting director Laurent Mekies.
            “It is helping us to understand if we have found the problem and if we can slowly solve it.”
            In the same car, however, Aston Martin-bound Vettel qualified a distant 15th.
            “It’s not just about being beaten – it’s a different league,” the quadruple world champion said afterwards.
            “Even the laps I was happy with are still too slow. At the moment I can only get out of it what is in me and the car,” Vettel added.
            Earlier in Portugal, Vettel said it was important that he used his final races for Ferrari to up his game and leave Maranello in style.
            “I haven’t changed my mind,” he insists. “I still consider it a privilege to be a Ferrari driver.
            “But everything comes to an end and the Ferrari chapter should end with a dignified farewell.
            “It’s no secret that I am not having the easiest year and it’s not exactly a love story in the last couple of years. But we’re working so hard to get the most out of the car for me. I know what I can do.”
            Finally, when asked by RTL’s Kai Ebel about what he is capable of in Sunday’s race, Vettel answered: “Next question.

        <h3>Drain cover collapse a new one for Masi</h3>
        Marshals and track officials went around the Algarve circuit checking each and every cover, leading to a 30 minute delay to the start of the qualifying.
        Masi says the problem was a new one for him.
        “It wasn’t actually the drain cover per se, it was actually the concrete case underneath that collapsed,” Masi told Autosport.
        “And then what we saw sticking up was the drain cover itself.
        “As soon as it was noticed, FP3 was obviously suspended, it couldn’t continue, and a repair was undertaken to that area.
        “Further checks were undertaken for a number of other drains at exactly the same point in time.
        “It’s something we haven’t really seen before, a collapse of that nature. So we checked all the other drains with all of the officials around the circuit, that was the most efficient way to get that done.
        “There were a couple of other cracks that were identified and repaired immediately.”

                <h3>Haas ‘rolling dice’ due to overheating suspension</h3>
                Romain Grosjean said an overheating rear suspension is making it almost impossible for Haas to find a good setup for the Portuguese GP.
                2019 was Haas‘ most difficult campaign in Formula 1 since arriving back in 2016, and this year their issues have shown no signs of going away.
                Grosjean and team-mate Kevin Magnussen now know they will not be with the team for 2021 and so are looking to raise their stock on the drivermarket, but a difficult qualifying session in Portimao means Grosjean will start the Portuguese GP from P18 with Magnussen set to line up P19.
                And Grosjean revealed that Haas have been suffering with constant overheating of the rear suspension which is causing the ride height to keep changing.
                “I can find a tenth maybe but there isn’t much more in the car,” he said after qualifying, as quoted by Crash.net.
                “We’re struggling with the rear suspension overheating, meaning that the platform, the ride height, keeps changing at the rear. From one lap to the other we can pick up up to 4% of aero balance.
                “When it gets hot at the end of third practice you get the ride height and then it cools down – and then you start qualifying with a different one and every lap the rear suspension heats up and the rear ride height changes. Normally we’re struggling a little bit but this weekend the magnitude is quite bigger and we’ve got no idea why.”

                <h3>Russell: Williams optimised FW43 for the race</h3>
                George Russell enjoyed a solid qualifying for Williams at the Portuguese GP, and hopes are high for the race.
                Russell once again made it out of Q1 in 2020, going on to put his Williams P14 on the grid for the Portuguese Grand Prix ahead of Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel.
                Race pace though has been an issue for Williams in 2020, but hopes are high for the race with Russell confirming that the FW43’s setup has been “optimised” for the race.
                “It is an amazing track and the car was feeling good,” he told the Williams website.
                “In the end I think we were only a tenth and a half from P11 which is extraordinary for us. We are all pushing as hard as we can to get everything we can out of this car, we are making good progress and the hard work is paying off.
                “We have a car that is more optimised for the race tomorrow, but we will have to wait and see how it unfolds as nobody knows how the tyres are going to handle this new circuit as FP2 got cut short.
                “It will be exciting, potentially with a bit of rain on the way, and I will be giving it everything I have got.”
